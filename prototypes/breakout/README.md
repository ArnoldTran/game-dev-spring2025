## Prototype 1

- What Were You Experimenting With Your Prototype?

Prototype 1 is a copy of Breakout. Protoype 1 was mainly to test out using Unity. Being new to game development, I wanted to mostly figure out the tools that Unity offers. I have experience in coding in the past, but wasn't too familiar with what was built into Unity such as the physics engine, prefabs etc. There wasn't anything significant added onto the game besides figuring out how fast I wanted the ball to move when it breaks bricks.

- What Did You Learn From Your Prototype?

I learned how to set up basic game mechanics such as ball movement and collision detection. I also learned how to set up the UI for the lives and score. Sometimes the ball would get stuck bouncing horizontally.

- Did You Learn Anything From Your Playtesters in Class? What?

There wasn't too much feedback to the game as it was very basic. I did learn about changing the paddle's collider body to be more round so the ball bounces better.
